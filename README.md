## Introduction

This is a collection of resources for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in
the Kansas City and St. Louis metropolitan areas. It is currently being
actively maintained and updated nightly with new data from the [Johns
Hopkins CSSE COVID-19
project](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Summaries of their
data for Missouri, Kansas, and Illinois are available in the `data/`
folder, and the most recent visualizations are available in the
`results/` folder. Historic data prior to March 22nd are now being
obtained from the [New York Times COVD-19
project](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

Separately, zip code data are being collected as of 2020-04-01 for the
City of St. Louis and 2020-04-06 for St. Louis County. Daily raw data, a
single table containing “long” versions of these raw data, and daily
snapshots are available in the `data/` folder as well. Maps and plots
tracking these in relation to race and poverty are available in
`results/`.
